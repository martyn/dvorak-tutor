This is a folder containing useful files for creating bookmarklets.

Copy it into any project directory and do the following:

1. Edit "urls" to point to files to concatenate, as in the example.
2. Run "./compose.py urls > final.js".

"final.js" now contains all the text in all the files in "urls", wrapped in an
anonymous function to avoid namespace conflicts.

The file "oneliner" will be the bookmarklet URL. Inside it, replace "URL" with
the online URL after uploading ("http://XXX/final.js"), and there it is!
